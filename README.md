## Workflow
    1. Work on a feature.
    2. `git stash` your changes.
    3. `git pull` from the remote branch.
    4. `git stash pop` to apply your stash. 
    5. `git commit` your changes.
    6. `git push` your changes.
    7. Start the process all over again.

## Policies
- Follow the workflow.
- No author name or license info included in the files (Tools > Templates in NetBeans).
- Try to `push` as few times as possible (fewer conflicts).
- Always add proper JavaDoc.
- *More coming later...*
