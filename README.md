## Coding Conventions


## Policies
- Follow the workflow!
- We use Redmine as our primary scrum board, and the whiteboard as our secondary one!
- Never push up code to the `master` branch that is not working, therefore the `master` branch should always work!
- Use the `dev` branch for unfinished code!
- No author name or license info included in the files (Tools > Templates in NetBeans)!
- Follow the coding conventions!
- Only `push` when it is necessary (fewer conflicts)!
- When you `commit` use the following in the header, so we can identify the tasks and user stories related to it: **ref #[idnum]**
- Always add proper JavaDoc!
- JavaDoc first, programming after!
- We always come to "work" on Monday, Tuesday and Friday!
- If it's possible we also meet on Wednesday and Thursday!
- If it's necessary we meet on the weekends as well!
- The usual working hours are between 10 am and 2 pm
- We always start with a 5 minutes Scrum Daily Meeting and we have a regular (preferably less then 1 hour) team meeting, but only if necessary.
- Come prepared to the meetings!
- Bring your sense of humor as well! **(Very important)**
